# Ethical Makeup Finder

The Ethical Makeup Finder is a Command Line Interface application that helps a user learn more about makeup brands and products that align with certain ethical priorities. The CLI uses the gem HTTParty to find all products in the database http://makeup-api.herokuapp.com/api/v1/products.json that are marked as either natural, vegan, or Fair Trade, according to the user's choice.

Upon choosing a priority, the user is told how many brands offer such products and how many different categories of makeup are represented. User can then choose to see a list of brands to research or to search further for a specific product. If the latter, a list of products is returned, from which the user can select a number to receive final purchase information.

## Installation

You are welcome to fork and clone your own copy of the Finder to tinker with, or go to the 'Code' menu and choose 'Download ZIP'.

## Usage

Input ruby bin/makeups in the terminal while the flatiron-project-1 directory is open.
